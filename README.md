# i'iwi
30 to 26 key, column-staggered, unibody-split keyboard using mousebites to snap off excess keys on the pinkies and thumbs. Named after the [i'iwi bird](https://www.mauiforestbirds.org/iiwi/), (“ee-EE-vee”), consider donating to the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project. 

Heavy inspiration from the zilpzalp, ʻākohekohe, grumpy and fitis.

## Firmware
ZMK is what I use and have setup a module for: [i'iwi ZMK Module](https://github.com/grassfedreeve/zmk-keyboards-iiwi) 
That being said the matrix is the same as a Hummingbird so you can use hummingbird firmware just fine on whichever firmware you enjoy.
